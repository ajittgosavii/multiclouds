# 📝 IMPORTANT: App File Naming

## ✅ **BOTH FILES INCLUDED FOR COMPATIBILITY**

This package includes **TWO identical main files**:

1. **streamlit_app.py** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
2. **app.py**

---

## 🎯 **WHICH ONE TO USE?**

### **In Streamlit Cloud Deployment:**

**Use:** `streamlit_app.py` (Streamlit's default)

When deploying to Streamlit Cloud:
- Main file path: **streamlit_app.py**

**Why?** Streamlit Cloud automatically looks for `streamlit_app.py` by default.

---

## 💡 **BOTH FILES ARE IDENTICAL**

- ✅ Both have the same code
- ✅ Both work perfectly
- ✅ Use whichever Streamlit Cloud prefers
- ✅ If one doesn't work, try the other

---

## 🚀 **RECOMMENDATION**

**When deploying to Streamlit Cloud:**
```
Main file path: streamlit_app.py
```

**This is Streamlit's default name and will work without any issues!**

---

## 📦 **BOTH FILES UPLOADED**

When you upload to GitHub, upload BOTH files:
- ✅ streamlit_app.py
- ✅ app.py

Streamlit Cloud will use `streamlit_app.py` automatically! ✨
